\chapter{Background}
Everything that is needed to understand you project that you have not made your self. Remember that the report should be written to a student on your level. Thus, material from the first couple of years can be general knowledge. Though if you some part extensively (e.g. further develop) it can be a good idea to recap. For example, if your project is to develop a better version of Dijkstra's algorithm~, it can be a good recap it. However, if you are developing a domain specific languages, there is no need to recap lexer/parser generators~, as these are used as tools.

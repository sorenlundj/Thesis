% English Abstract
\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This thesis deals in model-based testing and model generating in the maritime sector, specifically in the Maritime Connectivity Platform (MCP). After accounting for the benefits the MCP will receive on the basis of model-based testing, a manual model-building module is presented, which introduces such functionality. The MCP has implemented service instance specifications, that are to describe service instances in the form of an xml document. These are analyzed, where after an optimized specification structure is presented, which will allow for semi-autonomous model based testing. Eventually, the behaviors of the two model generating methods are verified through a series of function- and scenario-oriented tests, some of which conclude that the benefit of the automatic model creating module is near-equivalent to that of the manual module. It is concluded that the two model generators are beneficial in their separate ways, with the automatic solving the problem statement of this thesis, while the manual paves the way for future unthought of, model-based functionality.

\begin{resume}
\noindent
Dette speciale omhandler modelbaseret testing og modelgenerering i den maritime sektor, mere specifikt, i Maritime Connectivity Platform (MCP). Efter at have redegjort hvilke fordele MCP vil modtage på baggrund af modelbaseret testing er et manuelt modelbyggermodul præsenteret, der introducerer sådan funktionalitet. MCP har implementeret service instance specifikationer, der skal beskrive service instances, udformet som xml-dokumenter. Disse bliver analyseret, hvorefter en optimeret specifikationstruktur er præsenteret, der vil tillade semiautomatisk modelbaseret testing. Derefter er de to modelgeneratorers adfærd verificeret gennem en række funktion- og scenarieorienterede tests, hvorigennem det også konkluderes at fordelene, der opnås ved den automatiske modelgenerator er tæt på tilsvarende de fordele, der opnås ved det manuelle modul. Til sidst konkluderes det at de to modelgeneratorer er fordelagtige på hver deres måde, hvor det automatiske modul løser problemstilling, præsenteret i dette speciale, og det manuelle modul baner vejen for fremtidig, modelbaseret funktionalitet.
